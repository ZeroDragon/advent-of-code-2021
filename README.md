Advent Of Code 2021
===============================

All scripts are atomic (meaning, that they do not need to be
imported anywhere else)
Also all scripts uses only Vanilla JS (some require Node 16).
So, no extra requirements.

I just used `consolecolors` to colorize some outputs, but I believe
I ended deleting those outputs

ESLint used to lint all stuff
